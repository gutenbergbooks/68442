  <h2 class='c003'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c004'>With pencil and scraps of paper concealed behind the persons
of friends who had come to say good-bye at the Ellis Island
Deportation Station, Alexander Berkman hastily scribbled the last
lines of this pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c005'>I think it is the best introduction to this pamphlet to say that
before its writing was finished the rulers of America began deporting
men directly and obviously for the offense of <em>striking against
the industrial owners of America</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Red Ark” is gone. In the darkness of early morning it
slipped away, leaving behind many wives and children destitute
of support. They were denied even the knowledge of the sailing
of the ship, denied the right of farewell to the husbands and
fathers they may never see again. After the boat was gone, women
and children came to the dock to visit the prisoners, bringing such
little comforts as are known to the working class, seedy overcoats
for the Russian winter, cheap gloves and odds and ends of food.
They were told that the ship was gone. The refined cruelty of the
thing was too much for them; they stormed the ferry-house, broke
a window, screamed and cried, and were driven away by soldiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Red Ark” will loom big in American history. It is the
first picturesque incident of the beginning effort of the War Millionaires
to crush the soul of America and insure the safety of the
dollars they have looted over the graves of Europe and through
the deaths of the quarter million soldier boys whom American
mothers now mourn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yes, the “Red Ark” will go into history. Alexander Berkman
and Emma Goldman whom the screaming harlots of the yellow
press have chosen to call the “leaders” of those whose distinction
is that they have no leaders, are more fortunate than otherwise.
Berkman and Goldman have been deported as “Russians.” They
were born in Russia, but they did their thirty years’ work of enlightenment
in this, our America. I think they are therefore Americans,
in the best sense, and the best of Americans. They fought
for the elementary rights of men, here in our country when others
of us were afraid to speak, or would not pay the price. In all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the leading cities of this land, they have contributed to the intellectual
life of the younger, aspiring generation. I venture to say
that there is hardly a liberal in the United States whose life has not
been influenced directly or indirectly and made better, by Alexander
Berkman and Emma Goldman.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alexander Berkman spent in American prisons more years than
I like to remember. He did it deliberately. He did it for the welfare
of men, and the American portion of mankind. He never
hesitated to offer his life for his brother. I recall a picture; it is
in Russia. We were gathered in Moscow. It looked as though
the Revolution were going to its death. Everywhere the Soviet
armies were retreating, the masses were sinking into despair, the
German working class was not rising in rebellion as we had hoped,
the Austrians likewise; the White Terror was raising its head throughout
Russia. A pallid girl, a Russian-American immigrant returned
to her native country, held in her hand the bulletin of the day’s
news. “A hundred Alexander Berkmans distributed throughout
Europe at this time, and the history of Europe would be different!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Berkman wrote a book, “Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist,” which
is one of America’s vital literary products. It won for him the
admiration of such intellectuals here as had the courage to admire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “intellectuals” for the most part did not bid Emma Goldman
and Alexander Berkman good-bye. Most of those who dared to visit
the passengers of the “Red Ark” in their Ellis Island prison were
young men and women of the working class. That is as it should
be. It is in the working class where Goldman and Berkman’s brave
work will find the growth that will count. American plutocracy
knew this. That is why American plutocracy deported Alexander
Berkman and Emma Goldman.</p>

<p class='c005'>This pamphlet is the “good-bye message” of Alexander Berkman
and Emma Goldman; and I think it is in spirit the message of all
the passengers of the “Red Ark.” As such it appears first in this
form and will appear later in history. Read it and keep it for
the future.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>DEPORTATION—<em>Its Meaning and Menace</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c004'>The war is over, but peace there is not. On a score of fronts
human slaughter is going on as before; men, women, and children
are dying by the hundred thousands because of the blockade of
Russia; the “small nations” are still under the iron heel of the
foreign oppressor; Ireland, India, Egypt, Persia, Korea, and numerous
other peoples, are being decimated and exploited even more
ruthlessly than before the advent of the Great Prophet of World
Democracy; “self-determination” has become a by-word, nay, a
crime, and world-wide imperialism has gotten a strangle hold upon
humanity.</p>

<p class='c005'>What, then, has the Great War accomplished? To what purpose
the sacrifice of millions of human lives, the unnamable loss
in blood and treasure? What, especially, has happened in these
United States?</p>

<p class='c005'>Fresh in mind are still the wonderful promises made in behalf
of the War. It was to be the <em>last</em> war, a holy crusade of liberty
against tyranny, a war upon all wars that was to sweep the earth
clear of oppression and misery, and make the world safe for true
democracy.</p>

<p class='c005'>As with a sacred fire burned the heart of mankind. What soul
so small, what human so low, not to be inspired by the glorious
shibboleth of liberty and well-being for all! A tornado of social
enthusiasm, a new-born world consciousness, swept the United States.
The people were aflame with a new faith; they would slay the
Dragon of Despotism, and conquer the world for democracy.</p>

<p class='c005'>True, it was but yesterday their sovereign will registered a
mighty protest against human slaughter and bloodshed. With a
magnificent majority they had voted not to participate in the foreign
War, not to become entangled in the treacherous schemes of European
despotisms. Triumphantly they had elected as President of
the United States the man who “kept them out of the war” that he
might still keep them out of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then suddenly, almost over night, came the change. From Wall
Street sounded the bugle ordering the retreat of Humanity. Its
echo reverberated in Washington, and thence throughout the whole
country. There began a campaign of war publicity that roused the
tiger in man and fed his lust for blood and vengeance. The quiet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>phlegmatic German was transformed into the “Vicious Hun,” and
made the villain of the wildest stories of “enemy” atrocities and
outrages. The nation-wide propaganda of hatred, persecution, and
intolerance carried its subtle poison into the hearts of the obscurest
hamlet, and the minds of the people were systematically confused
and perverted by rivers of printer’s ink. The conscience of America,
wanting peace, was stifled in the folds of the national emblem,
and its voice drowned by the martial beat of a thousand war drums.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here and there a note of protest was heard. Radicals of various
political and social faiths—Anarchists, Socialists, I. W. Ws.,
some pacifists, conscientious objectors, and other anti-militarists—sought
to stem the tide of the war hysteria. They pointed out that
the people of the United States had no interest in the European
War. That this country, because of its geographical location and
natural advantages, was beyond all danger of invasion. They
showed that the War was the result of European over-preparedness
for war, aggravated by a crisis in capitalist competition, old monarchical
rivalries and ambitions of super-despotic rulers. The peoples
of Europe, the radicals emphasized, had neither say nor interest
in the war: they were the sheep led to slaughter on the altar of
Mammon contending against Baal. America’s great humanitarian
mission, the war protestants insisted, was to keep out of the war,
and use its potent influence and compelling economic and financial
power to terminate the European slaughter and bring peace to the
bleeding nations of the old world.</p>

<p class='c005'>But these voices of sanity and judgment were lost in the storm
of unloosed war passions. The brave men and women that dared
to speak in behalf of peace and humanity, that had the surpassing
integrity of remaining true to themselves and to their ideals, with
the courage of facing danger and death for conscience sake—these,
the truest friends of Man, had to bear the cross of Golgotha, as did
the Nazarene of yore, as the lovers of humanity have done all
through the centuries of human progress. The jail and lynch law
for them; execution and persecution by their contemporaries. But
if it be true that history repeats itself, surely these political “criminals”
of today will be hailed tomorrow as martyrs and pioneers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The popular war hysteria was roused and especially successfully
cultivated by the alleged progressive, “intellectual” element in the
United States. Their notoriously overwhelming self-esteem and
vanity had been subtly flattered by their fellow-intellectual, the
college professor become President. This American <em>intelligentzia</em>
inclusive of a good many quite unintelligent suffragettes, was the
real “balance of power” in the re-election of Woodrow Wilson.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>The silken cord (occasionally golden in spots) of mutual interest that
bound the President and the intellectual element ultimately proved
much stronger at their end than at his. The feeling of gratitude is
always more potent with the giver than with the recipient. Howbeit
the “liberals”, the “radicals”, were devoted heart and soul to the
professor,—they stood solidly behind the President, to use their own
intellectually expressive phrase.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shame upon the mighty power of the human mind! It was the
“radical intellectuals” who, as a class, turned traitors to the best interests
of humanity, perverted their calling and traditions, and became
the bloodiest canines of Mars. With a power of sophistry that the
Greek masters of false logic never matched, they cited history, philosophy,
science—aye, they called their very Christ to witness that the
killing of man by man is a most worthy and respectable occupation,
indeed a very Christian institution, and that wholesale human
slaughter, if properly directed and successfully conducted, is a
very necessary evolutionary factor, a great blessing in disguise.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was this “intellectual” element that by perversion of the human
mind turned a peace-demanding people into a war-mad mob. The
popular refusal to volunteer for Service was hailed by them as a
universal demand for military draft as “the most democratic expression
of a free citizenship.” Forced service became in their
interpretation “equality of contribution for rich and poor alike.”
The protest of one’s conscience against killing was branded by
them as high treason, and even mere disagreement regarding the
causes of the war, or the slightest criticism of the administration,
was condemned as disloyalty and pro-Germanism. Every expression
of humanity, of social sympathy, and understanding was cried down
with a Babel of high phrases, in which “patriotism” and “democracy”
competed in volume. Oh, the tragedy of the human mind
that absorbs fine words and empty phrases, and is deaf to motives
and blind to deeds!</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet there lacked unanimity in the strenuously cultivated war
demand. There was no popular enthusiasm for American participation
in the European holocaust. Mothers protested against their
children being torn from the home hearth; fathers hid their young
sons. The spirit of discontent was abroad. The Government had
to resort to drastic methods: the hand of white terror was lifted in
Washington. Again we raised our voices to warn the people,—we,
the revolutionists of various social views who remained true
to our ideal of human brotherhood and proletarian solidarity. We
pointed out that the masses of the world had nothing to gain and
everything to lose by war; that the chief sufferers of every war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>were the workers, and that they were being used as mere pawns
in the game of international diplomacy and imperialist capitalism.
We reminded the toilers that they alone possessed the power to
wage war or make peace, and that they—as the creators of the
world’s wealth—were the true arbiters of the fate of humanity.
Their mission, we reiterated, is to secure peace on earth, and the
product of labor to the producers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Emphatically we warned the people of America against the
policy of suppression by the enactment of special legislation. Alleged
war necessity was being used—we asserted—to incorporate
in the statute books new laws and new legal principles that would
remain operative <em>after</em> the war, and be effective for the continued
prohibition of governmentally unapproved thoughts and views. The
practice of stifling and choking free speech and press, established
and tolerated during the war, sets a most dangerous precedent for
after-war days. The principle of such outrages upon liberty once
introduced, it will require a long and arduous struggle to win back
the liberties lost. “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.” Thus
we argued.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here again the “intellectuals” and radicals of chameleon hue
hastened to the rescue of the forces of reaction. We were scoffed
at, our “vain fears” ridiculed. It was all for the best interests of
the country—the sophists protested—for the greater security and
glory of Democracy.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>II</h3>

<p class='c007'>Now reaction is in full swing. The actual reality is even darker
than our worst predictions. Liberty is dead, and white terror on
top dominates the country. Free speech is a thing of the past.
Not a city in the whole wide land but that forbids the least expression
of an unpopular opinion. It is descriptive of the whole situation
that after thirty years’ activity in New York, we are unable—upon
our return from prison—to secure any hall, large or small,
to lecture even on the subject of prison life or to speak on the
question of amnesty for political and industrial prisoners. The
doors of every meeting place are closed to us, as well as to other
revolutionists, by order of the powers that be.</p>

<p class='c005'>Free press has been abolished, and every radical paper that dares
speak out, is summarily suppressed. Raids of public gatherings,
of offices, and private dwelling places, accomplished with utmost
brutality and uncalled for violence, are of daily occurrence throughout
the United States. The headquarters of Anarchists, of Socialists,
of I. W. Ws., of the Union of Russian Workers, and numerous other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>progressive and educational organizations, have been raided by
the local police and Federal agents in practically every city of
this country. Men and women are beaten up indiscriminately, fearfully
clubbed and blackjacked without any provocation, frequently
to be released afterwards because no offence whatever could be
charged against them. Books and whole libraries of “radical centers”
are confiscated, even text books of arithmetic or geography
torn to shreds, furniture destroyed, pianos and victrolas smashed
to kindling wood—all in the name of the new Democracy and for
the safety of the glorious, free Republic of these United States.</p>

<p class='c005'>The half-baked radicals, their hearts as soft as their heads, now
stand aghast at this terrible sight. They had helped to win the
war. Some had sacrificed fathers, brothers, husbands—all of them
had suffered an agony of misery and tears, to help the cause of
humanity, to make the world safe for democracy. Is <em>this</em> what we
fought and bled for? they are asking. Have we been misled by the
fine-sounding phrases of a Professor, and have we in turn helped to
delude the people, the suffering masses of the world? Is the great
prophet of the New Democracy strong only in rhetoric?</p>

<p class='c005'>Pity the mind that awaits miracles and looks expectantly to a
universal Savior. The clear-sighted man, well informed, may reasonably
foresee the inevitability of certain results from given causes.
But only a charlatan can play the great Savior, and only the fool
has faith in him. Individuals, however great, may profoundly
influence, but are powerless to control, the fate of mankind. Deep
socio-political causes produced the war. The Kaiser did not create
it, though the spirit of Prussianism no doubt accelerated its coming.
Nor is President Wilson responsible for the present bloody peace.
He did not make the war: he was made by it. He did not make
the peace: he was unmade by it. The social and economic forces
that control the world are stronger than any man, than any set
of men. These forces are inherent in the fundamental institutions
of our wage-slave civilization, in the social atmosphere created by
it, and in the individual mind. These forces are by no means
harmonious. The human heart and mind, eternally reaching out
for greater joy and beauty—the spirit of idealism, in short—is constantly
at strife with the established, the institutionalized. These
contending social and human factors produce war, as they produce
revolution.</p>

<p class='c005'>The powers that succeeded in turning the instinctive current of
man’s idealism into the channels of war, became the masters of
human destiny for the nonce. By a campaign of publicity and
advertising on a scale history had never witnessed before, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>chicanery and lying, by exaggeration and misrepresentation, by
persistent and long-continued appeals to the basest as well as to
the noblest traits of man, by every imaginable and unprecedented
manner and method, the great financial interests, eager for war and
aided by the international Junkers, thrust humanity into the great
world war. Whatever of noble impulse and unsophisticated patriotism
there was in the hearts of the masses, in and out of uniform,
was soon almost totally drained in the fearsome rivers of human
blood, in the brutal, filthy, degrading charnel house of elemental
passions set on fire. But the tiger in man, once thoroughly awakened,
grew strong and more vicious with the sights he witnessed
and the food he was fed on. The basest propensities unchained, the
anti-social tendencies engendered and encouraged by the war, and
the war propaganda, are now let loose upon the country. Hatred,
intolerance, persecution and suppression—the efficient “educational”
factors in the preparedness and war campaign—are now permeating
the very heart of this country and propagating its virulent poison
into every phase of our social life.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there is no more “Hun” to be hated and lynched. Commerce
and business know their interests. We must feed Germany—at
a good profit. We must do business with its people. Exit the
Hun—<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">der Moor hat seine Schuldigkeit gethan</span></i>. What a significant
side-light on the artificiality and life-brevity of national and racial
antagonisms, when the fires of mutual distrust and hatred are not fed
by the interested stokers of business and religion! But the Frankenstein
and intolerance and suppression cultivated by the war campaign
is there, alive and vital, and must find some vent for his
accumulated bitterness and misery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh, there, the radical, the Bolshevik! What better prey to be
cast to the Frankenstein monster?</p>

<p class='c005'>The powers that be—the plutocratic imperialist and the jingo-profiteer—all
heave a happy sigh of relief.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>III</h3>

<p class='c007'>The after-war conditions in the United States are filling the
Government and the more intelligent, class-conscious capitalists with
trepidation. Revolution is stalking across Europe. Its spectre is
threatening America. Disquieting signs multiply daily. A new
discontent, boding ill and full of terrible possibilities, is manifest
in every walk of life. The war has satisfied no one. Only too
obviously the glorious promises failed of fulfilment. Excepting the
great financial interests and some smaller war profiteers, the American
people at large are aching with a poignant disappointment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Some vaguely, other more consciously and clearly, but almost all
feel themselves in some way victimized. They had brought supreme
sacrifices, suffered untold misery and pain, in the confident hope of
a great change to come into their lives after the victorious war, in
the assurance of a radically changed and bettered world.</p>

<p class='c005'>The people feel cheated. Not yet have they been able to fix their
gaze definitely upon the specific source of their disappointments, to
define the true causes of their discontent. But their impatience with
existing conditions is passionate and bitter, and their former faith
in the established order profoundly shaken. Significant symptoms
of a social breakdown! Revolutions begin in the heart and in the
mind. Action follows in due course. Political and industrial institutions,
bereft of the people’s faith in them, are doomed. The
changed attitude toward the once honored and sacred conditions,
now evident throughout the land, symbolizes the complete bankruptcy
of the existing order. The old conceptions and ideas underlying
present-day society are fast disintegrating. New ideals are germinating
in the hearts of the masses—a prolific soil, rich with the
promise of a brighter future. America is on the threshold of the
Social Revolution.</p>

<p class='c005'>All this is well realized by the financial and political masters
of this country. The situation is profoundly disquieting. But most
terrifying to them is the new attitude of labor. It is unprecedented,
intolerable in its complete disregard of long accepted standards
and conditions, its open rebellion against Things as They Are, its
“shameless demands,” its defiance of constituted authority. Is it
possible, the masters wonder, that we had gone too far in our
war-time promises of democracy and freedom, of justice to the
workers, of well-being for all? Too reckless was our motto, “Labor
will win the war”: it has given the toilers a sense of their power,
it has made them arrogant, aye, menacing. No more are they
satisfied with “a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work”; no, not
even with wages doubled and trebled. They are laying sacrilegious
hands upon the most sacrosanct institution of private ownership,
they challenge the exclusive mastery of the owner in his own mine
and mill, they demand actual participation in industry, even in
the most secret councils that control production and manipulate distribution,—aye,
they even dare suggest the taking over by labor
of all industry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unheard of impudence! Yet this is not all. More menacing
still is the revolutionary spirit that is beginning to transfuse itself
through every rank of labor, from the highest-paid to the lowest,
organized and the unorganized as well. Disobedience is rampant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Gone is the good old respect for orders, the will of superiors is
secretly thwarted or openly defied, the mystic power of contracts
has lost its old hold. Labor is in rebellion—in rebellion against
State and Capital, aye, even against their own leaders that have
so long held them in check.</p>

<p class='c005'>No time is to be lost! Quick, drastic action is necessary. Else
the brewing storm will overwhelm us, and the workers deprive us
of the wealth we have been at such pains to accumulate. Even
now there are such terribly disquieting rumblings, as if the very
earth were shaking beneath our feet—rumors of “the dictatorship
of the proletariat,” of “Soviets of workers, soldiers and sailors.”
Horrible thought! Why, if the soldiers <em>should</em> join these discontented
workers, what would become of us poor capitalists? Indeed,
have not the police of Boston already set the precedent—made
common cause with labor, these traitors to their masters!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Soviet of Workers,” dictatorship of the Proletariat! Why,
that’s the Russian idea, the terrible Bolshevik menace. Never shall
this, the most heinous crime, be forgiven Soviet Russia! Readily
would we overlook their repudiation of the Czar’s numerous obligations
and even their refusal to pay their debts to the American
and European money lenders. We’d find some way to recuperate
our losses, at a reasonable profit, maybe. But that they have
broken down the very pillars of capitalism, abolished profits, given
to the peasants the masters’ lands for cultivation and use, proclaimed
all wealth common property, and subjected the aristocrat
and capitalist to the indignity of working for a living—this hellish
arch-crime they shall never be forgiven.</p>

<p class='c005'>That such things should threaten the rich men of this free country
is intolerable. Nothing must be left undone to prevent such a
calamity. It would be terrible to be put on a level with the common
laborer, and we with all our millions unable to procure champagne,
because, forsooth, some hod-carrier’s brat—illegitimate, perchance—did
not get his milk for breakfast. Unthinkable! That is
chaos, anarchy! We must not permit our beloved country to come
to such a pass. Labor rebellion and discontent must be crushed,
energetically, forthwith. Bolsheviki ways and Soviet ideas must
gain no foothold in America. But the thing must be done diplomatically;
the workers must not be permitted to look into our cards.
We should be strong as a lion, subtle as the snake.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>IV</h3>

<p class='c007'>The war-time anti-Hun propaganda is now directed against the
“Bolshevik,” “the radical,” and particularly against the Slav or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>anything resembling him. The man or woman of Russian birth
or nationality is made the especial target. The press, the pulpit,
all the servile tools of capitalism and imperialism combine to paint
Russia, Soviet Russia, in colors of blood and infamy. No misrepresentation,
no lie too base to be flung at Russia. Falsehood
and forgery the weapons where guns and bayonets have failed.
The direct result of this poison propaganda is now culminating
in American pogroms against Russians, Bolsheviki, communists,
radicals, and progressives in general.</p>

<p class='c005'>The United States has fortunately always been free from the
vicious spirit of race hatred and persecution of the foreigner. The
native negro excepted, this country has known no race problem.
The American people were never guilty of harboring bitterness
or deep-seated prejudice against members of other nationalities.
In truth, the great majority of them are themselves of foreign birth
or descent, the only true native being the American Indian. Whatever
racial differences there may exist between the various nationalities
or stocks, they have never assumed the form of active strife.
On the contrary, they have always been of a superficial nature, due
to misunderstanding or other temporary causes, and have never
manifested themselves in anything save light, good-humored banter.
Even the much-advertised antagonism of the West toward the Chinese
and Japanese is not due to any inherent hatred, but rather
to very definite commercial and industrial factors. In the case of
the Russians especially, as well as in regard to members of the
various branches of the Slavic race, the people of America have
always been particularly friendly and well-disposed. But suddenly
all the war-time hatred toward the “Hun enemy,” the blindest
intolerance and persecution are poured upon the head of the Russian,
the Slav. Great indeed is the power of propaganda! Great
is the power of the American thought controller—the capitalist
press. The Russian has become the victim of American pogroms!</p>

<p class='c005'>Often and again in the past have we Anarchists pointed out
that the feudal lords of this land would follow, in their march to
imperialism, in the footsteps of the Czars of old Russia, and even
outdo their preceptors. Our liberal friends denounced us as
fanatics, alarmists, and pessimists. Yet now we are confronted with
a state of affairs in democratic America which, in point of brutality
and utter repudiation of every fundamental libertarian principle,
surpasses the worst autocratic methods the Czars of Russia ever
dared apply against political dissenters.</p>

<p class='c005'>The world is familiar with the story of the pogrom horrors practiced
upon the Jews of Czarist Russia. But what the world, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the American world, does not know is that every pogrom
in Russia was directly incited, financed, and prepared by the Government
as a means of distracting the attention of the Russian people
from the corrupt despotic regime under which they suffered—a
deliberate method of confusing and checking the fast growing discontent
and holding back the rising tide of revolutionary upheaval.</p>

<p class='c005'>But thoughtful people in Russia were not long deceived by this
hellish stratagem. That is why Russians of character and intelligence
never lent themselves to the practice of Jew-baiting and persecution.
The authorities frequently had to resort to importing the
human dregs of distant communities, fill them with vodka, and
then turn them loose on the defenceless Jews. These Black Hundreds
and hooligans of Czarist Russia were the infamous regime
now forever cast into the abyss of oblivion by the awakened and
regenerated spirit of New Russia. There have been no pogroms
in Soviet Russia.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Black Hundreds and the hooligans have now come to
life again—in democratic America. Here they are more mad and
pernicious than their Russian colleagues in crime had ever been.
Their wild orgies of assault and destruction are directed, not against
the Jew, but against the more comprehensive scape-goat of Capitalism,
“the alien,” the “radical.” These are being made the lightning
rod upon which is to be drawn all the fury of the storm that
is menacing the American plutocracy. As the Czars pointed at the
Jew as the sole source and cause of the Russian people’s poverty
and servitude, so the feudal lords of America have chosen the
“foreign radical,” “the Bolshevik” as the vicarious victim for the
sins of the capitalist order. But while no intelligent and self-respecting
Russian ever degraded himself with the Czar’s bloody work,
we see in our democracy so-called cultured people, professional
men and women, “good Americans,” inspired and aided by the
“respectable, reputable” press, turn into bestial mobs. We see high
Government officials, State and Federal, play the part of the hooligans,
encouraging and aiding the American Black Hundred of
legionaries, in a frenzied crusade against the “foreigner,” whose
sole crime consists in taking seriously the American guarantees of
free speech, free press, and free assembly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The war hate against everything German was vicious enough,
though the people of America were repeatedly assured that we were
not making war against the German people. One can understand
also, though not countenance, the vulgar clamor against the best
and finest expressions of German culture, the stupid prohibition
of the language of Goethe and Schiller, of the revolutionary music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of Wagner and Beethoven, the poetry of Heine, the writings of
Nietzsche, and all the other great creative works of Teuton genius.
But what possible reason is there for the post-war hatred toward
aliens in general and Russians in particular? The outrages and
cruelties perpetrated upon Germans in America during the war
pale almost into insignificance compared with the horrible treatment
the Russians in the United States are now subjected to. In
fact, the Czarist pogroms, barring a few exceptions, never rivaled
the fearful excesses now happening almost daily in various American
cities, their victims, men and women, guilty only of being
Russians.</p>

<p class='c005'>This state of affairs is the more significant because Russians,
and the Slavic people in general, were hitherto always welcomed
to these shores as the best offering Europe contributed to the Moloch
of American industry. The Slav was so good natured, and docile,
such a patient slave, so appreciative of the liberties he enjoyed in
the new land—“liberties” which the socially conscious American
had long since learned to see as a delusion and a snare. But to
the unsophisticated Russian peasant, always half-starved and browbeaten,
they seemed real and resplendant, the symbol of paradise
found. By the thousands he flocked to the promised land, swarmed
into the centers of industry to build our railroads, forge iron, dig
coal, till the soil, weave cloth, and toil at scores of other useful occupations,
his reward a mere pittance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nor was it only the workers in fields and factories who were
welcomed here from Russia. Russian culture was an honored guest
in America. The great literature of the Slav, his music, his dancing—all
found the most generous reception and fullest appreciation.
Above all, the Russian <em>intelligentzia</em>, the political refugees, exiles,
and active revolutionists that came to America, and came—most
of them—not merely to express their opinions but rather to plot
the forcible overthrow of the Russian autocracy, all found sympathetic
hearing and generous purses in this country, aye, even at
the seat of Government.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now? Now it is considered the most heinous crime to have
been born in Russia.</p>

<p class='c005'>What has caused this peculiar change? What is back of this
sudden reversal of feeling?</p>

<p class='c005'><em>It is the Russian Revolution</em>. Not, of course, the Miliukov-Kerensky
revolution, but the real revolution that gave birth to Soviet
Russia. The submissive, enslaved, long-suffering Russian people
unexpectedly transformed into a free, daring Giant breaking a
new path for the progress of mankind—that is the reason for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>changed attitude of the capitalistic world. It is one thing to help
Russian revolutionists to overthrow the Czar and to put in his place
a “democratic” form of government which has proven such a boon
to our own Czars of commerce and industry. But it is quite a
different thing to see the Prometheus of labor rise in his might, strike
off his chains, and with the full consciousness of his complete
economic power bring to life the dreams and aspirations of a thousand
years,—the economic, political, and spiritual emancipation
of the masses of the world. This pioneer social experiment now
being tried in Russia—the greatest and most fundamental ever
witnessed in all history—is the guiding star to all the oppressed
and disinherited of the world. Already its magic light is spreading
over the whole European horizon, the harbinger of the approaching
Dawn of Man. What if it should traverse the ocean and embrace
our own shores within its orbit? The whole social order
of the financial Czars, industrial Kaisers, and land Barons of
America is at stake: the “order” maintained by club and gun, by
jail and lynch law in and out of court; the “order” founded on
robbery and violence, built upon sham and unreason, artificiality
and insanity, and supported by misery and starvation, by the water-cure,
the dungeon and straitjacket; an “order” that transcends all
chaos and daily makes confusion worse confounded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such social “order” is doomed. It bears within itself the virus
of disintegration. Already the conscience of America is awakening.
The war marked the crisis. Already American men have chosen
imprisonment, torture, and death, rather than become participants
in an unholy war. Already American men and women are beginning
to realize the anti-social destructive character and purpose of
authority and government by violence, force, and fraud. Already
the workers of America are outgrowing the vicious circle of craft-unionism,
learning the lesson and the power of solidarity of the
international proletariat, and gaining confidence in their own initiative
and judgment, to the confusion and terror of their antiquated,
spineless leadership. Already they are seeing through the sham
of “equality before the law,” and are in open rebellion to government
by injunction.</p>

<p class='c005'>A spark from the glowing flame of Soviet Russia, and the purse-proud
autocracy of America may be swept away by the social
conflagration.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wherefore the united chorus of all Czars and Kaisers, “Death
to the Bolsheviki, the aliens, the I. W. Ws., the Communists, the
Anarchists!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c006'>V</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Whatever might be said of the American plutocracy and the
Government, no one can accuse them of originality. The methods
used by them to confuse and confound the people are but cheap
imitations of the old tactics long resorted to by the despotic rulers
of Europe. Even before the world war Washington had borrowed
many a trick from London. And all through the war American
militarism, with its conscription, espionage, torture of conscientious
objectors, and suppressive legislation, was but aping—stupidly and
destructively—the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of the bankrupt imperialism of
the Old World. For lack of originality and ideas, American officialdom
was content to be the echo of the military and court circles of
London and Paris. And now again we witness Washington following
in the exact footsteps of the worst autocracy of modern times.
For the hue and cry against the “alien” is a faithful replica of the
persecution of the Jews by the Czars of Russia, and the American
pogroms against radicals are the exaggerated picture of Russian
Jew-baiting.</p>

<p class='c005'>And, finally, the most infamous and most inhuman method of
Czarist Russia, the method that sacrificed hundreds of thousands
of the finest and bravest men and women of Russia, and systematically
robbed the country of the very flower of its youth, is now
being transplanted on American soil, in these great United States,
the freest democracy on earth. The dreaded Russian <em>administrative
process</em> the newest American institutions! Sudden seizure,
anonymous denunciation, star chamber proceedings, the third degree,
secret deportation and banishment to unknown lands. O
shades of Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and Patrick Henry! That you
must witness the bloodiest weapon of Czarism rescued from the
ruins of defunct absolutism and introduced into the country for
whose freedom you had fought so heroically!</p>

<p class='c005'>What means the administrative process?</p>

<p class='c005'>It means the suppression and elimination of the political protestant
and social rebel. It is the practice of picking men upon the
street, on the merest suspicion of “political untrustworthiness,” of
arresting them in their club rooms or homes, tearing them away
from their families, locking them up in jails or detention pens,
holding them <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">incommunicado</span></i> for weeks and months, depriving them
of a hearing in open court, denying them trial by jury, and finally
deporting them or banishing them to unknown shores. All this,
not for any crime committed or even any punishable act charged,
but merely on the denunciation of an enemy or the irresponsible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>accusation by a Secret Service man that the “suspect” holds certain
unpopular or “forbidden” opinions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lest the truth or accuracy of this statement be called in question,
let it be stated that at this very moment there are one hundred such
“political suspects” held at Ellis Island, with several hundred more
in the various Immigration Detention jails, every one of them a
victim of the administrative process described above. Not one of
them is charged with any specific crime; one and all are accused of
entertaining “illegal” views on political or Social questions. Nearly
all of them have been seized on the street or arrested in their
homes or reading-rooms while engaged in the dangerous pursuit of
studying the English language, mathematics, or American history.
(The latter seems lately to be regarded by the authorities as a
particularly dangerous occupation, and those guilty of it a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</span></i> menace to our American institutions.) Others were arrested
in the factory, at their work bench, or in the numerous recent raids
of homes and peaceful meetings. Many of them were beaten and
clubbed most brutally, the wounds of some necessitating hospital
treatment. In the police stations they were subjected to the third
degree, threatened, tortured, and finally thrust into the bull pens
of Ellis Island. Here they are treated as dangerous felons, kept
all the time under lock and key, and allowed to see their wives and
families only once a week, with a screen between them and malicious
guards constantly at their side. Here their mail is subjected to the
most stringent censorship, and their letters delivered or not, according
to the whims of the petty officials in charge. Here some
of them, because they dared protest against their isolation and the
putrid food, were placed in the insane asylum. Here it was that
the brutal treatment and unbearable conditions of existence drove
men and women, the politicals awaiting deportation, to the desperate
extremity of a hunger strike, the last resort of defenseless beings,
the paradoxical self-defense of despair. For weeks and months
these men have now been kept prisoners at Ellis Island, tortured
by the thought of their wives and children whom the Government
has ruthlessly deprived of support, and living in constant uncertainty
of the fate that is awaiting them, for the good American Government,
refinedly cruel, is keeping their destination secret, and
certain death may be the goal of the deportees when the hour of
departure finally strikes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such is the treatment and the fate of the first group of Russian
refugees from American “democracy.” Such is the process known
as the administrative methods, penalizing governmentally unapproved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Thought, suppressing <em>disbelief</em> in the omniscience of the
powers that be.</p>

<p class='c005'>In enlightened, free America. Not in Darkest Russia.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the terrible significance of the administrative process practiced
in Russia became known in Europe, civilization stood aghast.
It caused a storm of protest in the British Parliament, and called
forth violent interpellations in the Italian Diet and the French
Chamber. Even the German Reichstag, in the days of the omnipotent
Kaiser, ventured a heated debate of the barbaric administrative
process which doomed thousands of innocents to underground
dungeons and the frozen <em>taigas</em> of Siberia.</p>

<p class='c005'>Are the Czar’s methods, the Third Section, the secret political
spy organizations, anonymous denunciations, star chamber proceedings,
deprivation of trial, wholesale deportations and banishment,
to become an established American institution? Let the people
speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>The full significance of the principle of deportation is becoming
daily more apparent. The field of its menace is progressively
broadening. Not only the alien social rebel is to be crushed by the
new White Terror. Its hand is already reaching out far for the
naturalized American whose social views are frowned upon by the
Government. And yet deeper it strikes. One hundred per cent
Americanism is to root out the last vestige, the very memory, of
traditional American freedom. Not alone foreigners, but the
naturalized citizen and the native-born are to be mentally fumigated,
made politically “reliable” and governmentally <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">kosher</span></i>, by
eliminating the social critics and industrial protestants, by denaturalization
and banishment, by exile to the Island of Guam or to
Alaska, the future Siberia of the United States.</p>

<p class='c005'>Following the “alien radical,” the naturalized American is the
first victim of the Czarification of America. Patriotic profiteers
and political hooligans are united in the cry for the “Americanization”
of the foreigner in the United States. He is to be “naturalized,”
intellectually sterilized and immunized to Bolshevism, so that
he may properly appreciate the glorious spirit of American democracy.
Simultaneously, however, the Federal Government is introducing
the new policy of summarily depriving the naturalized American
of his citizenship, in order to bring him when so desired, within
the scope of the administrative process which subjects the victim
to deportation without trial.</p>

<p class='c005'>A most important precedent had already been set. The case
of Emma Goldman affords significant proof to what lengths the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Government will go to rid itself of a disquieting social rebel, though
he be a citizen for a quarter of a century.</p>

<p class='c005'>The story is interesting and enlightening. More than eight years
ago Secret Service men of the Federal Government were ordered to
gather “material” in Rochester, N. Y., or elsewhere, that would
enable the authorities to disfranchise a certain Rochester citizen.
The man in question was of no concern whatever to Washington, as
subsequent events proved. He was an ordinary citizen, a quiet working
man, without any interest in social or political questions. He
was never known to entertain any unpopular views or opinions.
As a matter of fact, the man had long been considered dead by his
local friends and acquaintances; since he had disappeared from his
home years previously and no clue to his whereabouts or any sign
that he was still among the living could be found; indeed, has not
been found till this day, notwithstanding the best efforts. At great
expense, and with considerable winking at its own rules and regulations
in such matters, the United States Government finally disfranchised
the man—the corpse, perhaps, for anything known to
the contrary. The proceeding necessitated a good deal of secrecy
and subterfuge, for even the wife of the man in question, whose
status as citizen by right of her marriage was involved, was not
apprised by the Government of its intended action. On the pretext
that the man was not fully of legal age at the time of his naturalization—about
20 years before—the mighty Republic of America declared
the citizenship of the man of unknown whereabouts and
against whom no crime or offence of any kind was ever charged, as
null and void.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten years passed. The disfranchised citizen, so far as humanly
known, was still as dead as at the time of his denaturalization. No
trace of him could be found, and nothing more was heard of the
motives and purposes of the Government in depriving of citizenship
a man who had apparently been dead for years. Dark and peculiar
are the ways of Government.</p>

<p class='c005'>More time passed. Then it became known that the United States
Government intended to deport Emma Goldman. But Emma Goldman
had acquired citizenship by marriage 30 years before, and,
as a citizen, she could not be deported under the present laws of the
United States. But lo and behold! The Government suddenly
announced that Emma Goldman was a citizen no more, because her
husband had been disfranchised ten years ago!</p>

<p class='c005'>Dark and peculiar indeed are the ways of government. But
there is method in its madness.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>What a striking comment this case affords on the true character
of government, and the chicanery and subterfuge it resorts to when
legal means fail to achieve its purposes. Long did the United
States Government bide its time. The moment was not propitious
to get rid of Emma Goldman. But she must be gotten rid of, by
fair means or foul. Yet public sentiment was not ready for such
things as deportation and banishment. Patience! The hour of a
great popular hysteria will come, will be made, if necessary, and
then we shall deport this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bete noir</span></i> of government.</p>

<p class='c005'>The moment has now come. It is here. The national hysteria
against radicals, inspired and fed by the bourgeois press, pulpit,
and politicians, has created the atmosphere needed to introduce
in America the principle and practice of banishment. At last the
Government may deport Emma Goldman, for through the width
and breadth of the country there is not a Judge—and possibly not
even a jury—with enough integrity and courage to give this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfant
terrible</span></i> a fair hearing and an unprejudiced examination of her claim
to citizenship.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore Emma Goldman is to be deported.</p>

<p class='c005'>But her case sets a precedent, and American life is ruled by legal
precedents. Henceforth the naturalized citizen may be disfranchised,
on one pretext or another, and deported because of his or
her social views and opinions. Already Congress is preparing to
embody this worthy precedent in our national legislation by passing
special laws providing for the disenfranchisement of naturalized
Americans for reasons satisfactory to our autocratic regime.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus another link is forged to chain the great American people.
For it is against the liberties and welfare of the people at large
that these new methods are fundamentally directed. Not merely
against Emma Goldman, the Anarchists, the I. W. Ws., Communists,
and other revolutionists. These are but the primary victims, the
prologue which introduces and shadows forth the tragedy about to
be enacted.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ultimate blow of the imperialist plutocracy of America is
aimed at Labor, at the increasing discontent of the masses, their
growing class-consciousness, and their progressive aspiration for
more joy and life and beauty. The fate of America is in the
balance.</p>

<p class='c005'>That is the true meaning and the real menace of the principle
of deportation, banishment, and exile, now being introduced in the
life of the United States. That is the purpose of the State and
Federal Anti-Anarchist laws, criminal-syndicalist-legislation, and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>similar weapons that the master class is forging for the defeat of
the awakening proletariat of America.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shall the United States, once the land of opportunity, the refuge
of all the oppressed, be Prussianized, Czarified? Shall the melting
pot of the world be turned into a fiery caldron brewing strife
and slaughter, spitting tyranny and assassination? Shall we here,
on this soil baptized with the sacred blood of the great heroes of
the Revolutionary War, engage in the sanguinary struggle of brother
against brother? Shall we re-enact in this land the frightful nightmare
of Darkest Russia? Shall this land re-echo the horrible tramp,
tramp of a thousand feet, on their way to an American Siberia?
Tortured bodies, manacled hands, clanking chains, in weary, endless
procession—shall that be the heritage of our youth? Shall the
songs of mothers be turned into a dirge, and little babies be suckled
with the teat of hate?</p>

<p class='c005'>No, it shall not be. There is yet time to pause, to turn back.
High time, high time for the voice of every true man and woman,
of every lover of liberty, to thunder forth such a mighty collective
protest that shall reverberate from North to South, and East to
West, and rouse the awakened manhood of America to a heroic stand
for Liberty and Justice.</p>

<p class='c005'>But if not,—if our warning prediction unhappily come true and
the fearful tragedy be played to its end, yet shall we not despair,
nor misdoubt the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finale</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hateful is the Dream of Oppression. And as vain. Where the
man who could name the judges that doomed Socrates? Where the
persecutors of the Gracchi, the banishers of Aristides, the excommunicators
of Spinoza and Tolstoy? Their very memory is obliterated
by the footsteps of Progress. Unceasingly it marches, forward
and upward, all obstacles notwithstanding, keeping time with the
heart beats of Humanity. Vain the efforts to halt it, to banish ideas,
to strangle thought. Vain the frenzied struggle to turn back the
hands of Time. The mightiest Goliath of Reaction has fought his
last fight—his final gesture, Old Russia, a hopeless surrender. Too
late to revive this corpse. It is beyond resurrection. Attempts
there may be, aye, will be, for the Bourbons never learn,—and
the people are long suffering. But attempts useless, destructive,
utterly fatal to their purpose. The Dream of Reaction ends in
abysmal nightmare.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is darkest before dawn, in history as in nature. But the dawn
has begun. In Russia. Its light is a promise and the hope of the

  <h2 class='c003'>WHAT’S TO BE DONE?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Men and women of America, there is much work to be done.
If you hate injustice and tyranny, if you love liberty and beauty,
there is work for you. If oppression rouses your indignation, and
the sight of misery and ugliness makes you unhappy, there is work
for you. If your country is dear to you and the people your kin,
there is work for you. There is much to be done.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whoever you are, artist or educator, writer or worker—be you
but a true man or true woman—there is important work for you.
Let not prejudice and narrow-mindedness blind you. Let not a
false press mislead you. Permit not this country to sink to the
depths of despotism. Do not stand supinely by, while every passing
day strengthens reaction. Rouse yourself and others to resent
injustice and every outrage on liberty. Demand an open mind and
fair hearing for every idea. Hold sacred the right of expression:
protect the freedom of speech and press. Suffer not Thought to be
forcibly limited and opinions proscribed. Make conscience free,
undisciplined. Allow no curtailment of aspirations and ideals.
These are the levers of progress, the fountain-head of joy and
beauty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Join your efforts, lovers of humanity. Do not uphold the hand
that strangles Life. Align yourselves with the dreamers of the
Better Day. The cause is worthy, the need urgent. The future
looks towards you, its voice calls you, calls.</p>

<p class='c005'>May it not call in vain.</p>

<p class='c005'>And you, fellow workers in factory, mine, and field, a great mission
is yours. You, the feeders of the world and the creators of
its wealth, you are the most interested in the fate of your country.
The menace of despotism is greatest to you. Long has your masters’
service humiliated and degraded you. Will you permit yourselves
to be driven into still more abject slavery? Your emancipation is
<em>your</em> work. Others may help, but you alone can win. In shop and
union, take up this your greatest problem. Let not the least of you
be victimized. Remember, an injury to one is the concern of all.
No worker can stand alone in the face of organized capitalism with
all its legislative and military weapons. Learn solidarity: each
with a common purpose, all with a common effort. Know your
enemy: there is no “mutual interest” between the robber and the
robbed. Understand your true friends. You’ll always find them
maligned and persecuted by <em>your</em> enemies. The idealists, the seekers
of the slaveless world, speak from <em>your</em> heart. Give them
hearing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Your fate, the fate of the country, is in <em>your</em> hands. Yours is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the mightiest power. There is no strength in the Government, except
you give it. No strength in your masters, except you suffer it.
The only true mastery is in you, the working class, in your power
to feed and clothe the world and make it joyous. The greatest
power, for good or evil. Use it for liberty, for justice. Allow no
suppression of the freedom of thought and speech, for it is a snare
for <em>your</em> undoing. Sooner or later every suppression comes home
to labor, for its greater enslavement. Realize the menace of deportation,
of the principle of banishment and exile. ’Tis the latest
method of the American plutocracy to silence the discontent of
the workers. Lose no time. It is of the most vital importance to
you. It threatens you, your union, your very existence. Take
the matter up in your organizations. The fortunes of labor in
America are at stake. Only your united effort can conquer the
peril that menaces you. Take action. Rouse the workers of the
whole country. In union and solidarity, in clear purpose and
courage is your only salvation.</p>

<p class='c007'>All eyes are opening to the rights of man. The general spread of
the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable
truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles
on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride
them legitimately, by the grace of God.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c005'>Societies exist under three forms, sufficiently distinguishable: (1)
Without government, as among our Indians. (2) Under governments
wherein the will of every one has a just influence; as is the
case in England, in a slight degree, and in our States, in a great
one. (3) Under governments of force; as is the case in all other
monarchies, and in most of the other republics. To have an idea
of the curse of existence under these last, they must be seen. It is
a government of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not clear in my
mind, that the first condition is not the best. But I believe it to be
inconsistent with any great degree of population. The second state
has a great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that,
enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has its evils,
too; the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject.
But weight this against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes
nothing. Even this evil is productive of good. It prevents the
degeneracy of governments, and nourishes a general attention to
the public affairs. I hold it, that a little rebellion, now and then,
is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms
in the physical. Unsuccessful rebellions, indeed, generally establish
the encroachments on the rights of the people, which have produced
them. An observation of this truth should render honest republican
governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as not to discourage
them too much. It is a medicine necessary for the sound
health of governments.</p>

this land. Am I not vehemently told both at the North and the South

right to speak on any other subject, in opposition to public opinion,
is equally denied to me.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but
is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as Truth, and as
uncompromising as Justice. On this subject I do not wish to think,

house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately
rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher; tell the mother
to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen—but

<h4 class='c009'>STEPHEN PEARL ANDREWS</h4>

<p class='c007'>Governments have hitherto been established, and have apologized
for the unseemly fact of their existence, from the necessity
of establishing and maintaining order; but order has never yet been
maintained, revolutions and violent outbreaks have never yet been
ended, public peace and harmony have never yet been secured, for
the precise reason that the organic, essential, and indestructible
natures of the objects which it was attempted to reduce to order
have always been constricted and infringed by every such attempt.
Just in proportion as the effort is less and less made to reduce men
to order, just in that proportion they become more orderly, as witness
the difference in the state of society in Austria and the United
States. Plant an army of one hundred thousand soldiers in New
York, as at Paris, to preserve the peace, and we should have a bloody
revolution in a week; and be assured that the only remedy for what
little of turbulence remains among us, as compared with European
societies, will be found to be more liberty. When there remain
positively no external restrictions, there will be positively no disturbance,
provided always certain regulating principles of justice,
to which I shall advert presently, are accepted and enter into the
public mind, serving as substitutes for every species of repressive
laws.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>HENRY GEORGE</h4>

<p class='c007'>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces
that, producing inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the
clouds begin to lower. Liberty calls to us again. We must follow
her further; we must trust her fully. Either we must wholly accept
her or she will not stay. It is not enough that men should vote;
it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before the
law. They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities
and means of life; they must stand on equal terms with
reference to the bounty of nature. Either this, or Liberty withdraws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>her light! Either this, or darkness comes on, and the very forces
that progress has evolved turn to powers that work destruction.
This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries. Unless
its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>HENRY DAVID THOREAU</h4>

<p class='c007'>Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their
respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of
injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for
law is that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal,
privates, powder-monkeys, and all, marching in admirable order
over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, aye, against their
common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching
indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart. They have no
doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned;
they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all?
or small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous
man in power?</p>

<p class='c005'>The mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but
as machines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and
the militia, gaolers, constables, posse comitatus, etc. In most cases
there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral
sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and
stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will
serve the purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men
of straw or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only
as horses and dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed
good citizens.</p>

<p class='c005'>Others—as most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and
office-holders—serve the State chiefly with their heads; and as they
rarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the
devil, without <em>intending</em> it, as God.</p>

<p class='c005'>How does it become a man to behave toward this American government
today? I answer, that he cannot without disgrace, be associated
with it. I cannot for an instant recognize that political organization
as <em>my</em> government which is the <em>slave’s</em> government also.</p>

refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny

<p class='c007'>All writers on the science of policy are agreed, and they agree

rules of justice to support themselves; that truth must give way
to dissimulation, honesty to convenience, and humanity to the reigning
interest. The whole of this mystery of iniquity is called the
reason of state. It is a reason which I own I cannot penetrate. What
sort of a protection is this of the general right, that is maintained
by infringing the rights of particulars? What sort of justice is
this which is enforced by breaches of its own laws? These paradoxes
I leave to be solved by the able heads of legislators and politicians.
For my part, I say what a plain man would say on such occasion.
I can never believe that any institution, agreeable to nature, and
proper for mankind, could find it necessary, or even expedient, in
any case whatsoever, to do what the best and worthiest instinct of
mankind warn us to avoid. But no wonder that what is set up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>opposition to the state of nature should preserve itself by trampling

because the more does it regulate its own affairs, and
govern itself; but so contrary is the practice of old governments to
the reason of the case, that the expenses of them increase in the
proportion they ought to diminish. It is but few general laws that
civilized life requires, and those of such common usefulness, that
whether they are enforced by the forms of government or not, the
effect will be nearly the same. If we consider what the principles
are that first condense men into society, and what the motives that
regulate their mutual intercourse afterwards, we shall find, by the
time we arrive at what is called government, that nearly the whole
of the business is performed by the natural operation of the parts

<h4 class='c009'>JOHN STUART MILL</h4>

<p class='c007'>Mankind can hardly be too often reminded, that there was once
a man named Socrates, between whom and the legal authorities
and public opinion of his time, there took place a memorable collision.
Born in an age and country abounding in individual greatness,
this man has been handed down to us by those who best knew
both him and the age, as the most virtuous man in it; while we
know him as the head and prototype of all subsequent teachers of
virtue, the source equally of the lofty inspiration of Plato and the
judicious utilitarianism of Aristotle, the two headsprings of ethical
as of all other philosophy. Their acknowledged master of all the
eminent thinkers who have since lived—whose fame, still growing
after more than two thousand years, all but outweighs the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>remainder of the names which make his native city illustrious—was
put to death by his countrymen, after a judicial conviction, for
impiety and immorality. Impiety, in denying the Gods recognized
by the State; indeed his accusers asserted (see the “Apologia”) that
he believed in no gods at all. Immorality, in being, by his doctrines
and instructions, a “corrupter of youth.” Of these charges the
tribunal, there is every ground for believing, honestly found him
guilty, and condemned the man who probably of all then born had
deserved best of mankind, to be put to death as a criminal.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>HERBERT SPENCER</h4>

<p class='c007'>When we have made our constitution purely democratic, thinks
to himself the earnest reformer, we shall have brought government
into harmony with absolute justice. Such a faith, though perhaps
needful for the age, is a very erroneous one. By no process can
coercion be made equitable. The freest form of government is only
the least objectionable form. The rule of the many by the few
we call tyranny: the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also,
only of a less intense kind. “You shall do as we will, and not as
you will,” is in either case the declaration; and, if the hundred
make it to ninety-nine instead of the ninety-nine to the hundred, it
is only a fraction less immoral. Of two such parties, whichever
fulfills this declaration, necessarily breaks the law of equal freedom:
the only difference being that by the one it is broken in the persons
of ninety-nine, whilst by the other it is broken in the persons of a
hundred. And the merit of the democratic form of government consists
solely in this,—that it trespasses against the smallest number.</p>

<p class='c005'>The very existence of majorities and minorities is indicative of
an immoral state. The man whose character harmonizes with the
moral law, we found to be one who can obtain complete happiness
without establishing the happiness of his fellows. But the enactment
of public arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of
men otherwise constituted—implies that the desires of some cannot
be satisfied without sacrificing the desires of others—implies that
in the pursuit of their happiness the majority inflict a certain amount
of <em>un</em>happiness on the minority—implies, therefore, organic immorality.
Thus, from another point of view, we again perceive that
even in its most equitable form it is impossible for government to
disassociate itself from evil; and further, that, unless the right to
ignore the State is recognized, its acts must be essentially criminal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cause of the miserable condition of the workers is slavery.
The cause of slavery is legislation. Legislation rests on organized
violence. It follows that an improvement in the condition of the
people is possible only through the abolition of organized violence.
“But organized violence is government, and how can we live without
governments? Without governments there will be chaos, anarchy;
all the achievements of civilization will perish, and the people will
revert to their primitive barbarism.” But why should we suppose
this? Why think that non-official people could not arrange it, not
for themselves, but for others? We see, on the contrary, that in
the most diverse matters people in our times arrange their own
lives incomparably better than those who govern them arrange for
them. Without the least help from government, and often in spite
of the interference of government, people organize all sorts of social
undertakings—workmen’s unions, co-operative societies, railway
companies, and syndicates. If collections for public works are
needed, why should we suppose that free people could not without
violence voluntarily collect the necessary means, and carry out all
that is carried out by means of taxes, if only the undertakings in
question are really useful for anybody? Why suppose that there
cannot be tribunals without violence?</p>

<p class='c005'>The robber generally plundered the rich, the governments generally
plunder the poor and protect those rich who assist in their
crimes. The robber doing his work risked his life, while the governments
risk nothing, but base their whole activity on lies and
deception. The robber did not compel anyone to join his band,
the governments generally enrol their soldiers by force. All who
paid the tax to the robber had equal security from danger. But in
the state, the more any one takes part in the organized fraud the
more he receives not merely of protection, but also of reward.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
